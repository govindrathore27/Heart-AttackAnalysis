# Heart-Attack Analysis
!{}(https://images.medicinenet.com/images/illustrations/heart_attack.jpg)


Main highlights of the notebook:
### - Outlier detection using IQR(Inter Quartile Range).
### - Normalising data using Robust scalar(which uses IQR and Median for normalising the data rather than mean and variance).
### - Using GridSearch to optimise the hyperparameters to get higher accuracy.
